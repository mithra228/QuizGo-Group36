In this tutorial we created a React Native Quiz App from the scratch.So for this app we just created a quiz app of having 5 questions and the app will display the users score and an option to restart the quiz.
so for this first 
1.We launched a react native project and installed all the required dependencies that are required for the setup process of the first step.
2.We designed a user interface where we have questions,options and a restart button.
3.We processed the data from the quiz by creating an object or array using JavaScript to store the questions and the correct choices.
4.We have written the logic to display the questions in a sequential order and let the users to choose the correct answers and calculate the scores on the correct choices has been implemented in the quiz.
5.After the Quiz has been done the app displays the score of the user and the total no.of questions they have been tried.
6. At last we have implemented the reset button where users can start the quiz again and try once again.
we ran our app in an android emulator using npm run android.
